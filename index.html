<h1>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SOFTWARE PROGRAMMER</h1>
<p> 

Every job has an air of mystery to it. As we see the countless commuters in the morning, questions flit through our minds: What do those people do all day? Are they worth the money they make? What goes on in their workplace?.<br>
Software development is a relatively new field, and as such is shrouded in more mystery than many other disciplines. So we’ve taken a look behind the curtain to look at a typical day for a software dev.<br>
Before we dive in, we should add two disclaimers: Obviously, the job varies day to day. Also, every company has its own culture and quirks. We’ll start with some context for project work.<br>

<h2> SPRINTS AND MORNINGS</h2>
<p>
If you’re working as part of an agile development team, that will include roughly 5 or more people, and reaching anything up to 10. (Agile development includes Extreme Programming [XP], Scrum, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method [DSDM], Lean Development, and Feature-Driven Development [FDD] among other disciplines.)
Generally you’ll be working in “sprints”: The idea is that rather than working on a large project in a single run, it’s broken down into two-week sprints. Everyone on the dev team would take a task that’s suited to them (either chosen by the dev themself or assigned by their manager/supervisor).
Then, every morning there’s a shorter session to assess progress. These would typically involve standup meetings of 10-15 minutes where everyone says what they’ve achieved, what they’re struggling or blocked with (if anything) and what they’re going to be doing that day.
